Problem Statement
Shopping assistance
Problem:
In NITT there are only two shops where daily life stuffs are available for those people who live in NITT campus. Generally what happen many times the people did not get the things what they wanted. People visiting the shops again and again but still they did not get the things which they wanted. 
Solution:
So for that problem here we want to make a portal for checking the stuff that it is available or not in the shop. People can visit the shop online, if the thing which the person wants to purchase is available, the person can visit the shop and can purchase it. If the person wants a thing so he can post a query on portal, when the thing will available in shop it will notify to the person via email or sms .But online payment is not available here.
